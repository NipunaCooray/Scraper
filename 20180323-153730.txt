A friend was holding my 6 month old he had his arm tucked behind his legs holding him up right and wasn't supporting his back when my LO flung back and he caught him at the last minute. I was horrified and can't get the image out of my head. His poor little neck and back flung right back and his knees stayed bent, I'm worried he could be hurt from the near fall or the jerk from flinging backwards and being caught at the last minute. How will I know if it's hurt him?? 
I feel terrible I shouldn't of let our friend hold him. My partner and I are horrified by the what ifs an have vowed to never let anyone else hold him Untill he is bigger.

I'm sure he is fine.  Babies fling themselves around all the time.  They are tough.  Perhaps instead of not letting anyone else hold him you could just warn them that he tends to fling himself back so the can make sure they keep an arm behind him.

Did your baby actually hit anything?  The floor?  Furniture?  If not I'm sure he is fine but if you're really concerned then take him to the doctor.  At six months he is just getting to the age where he will start moving, falling over when trying to sit, knocking his head when he is trying to pull up on things.  At six months they are well past the precious, fragile baby stage & are pretty robust to handle something like that.

How is he now? Is he upset? I think how he is would determine if I did anything.

Just so you know, I fell down a flight of stairs holding my 9week old. He was fine. 

However if you are unsure speak to a professional.

Don't feel terrible you weren't to know this would happen.

It's impossible for us to know if your baby sustained an injury or not but I can see in my head what happened (from what you described) so I see why you are worried.
Would you consider calling one of the help lines in the link below?
You could speak to a health professional and they will be able to ask you the right questions to help work out if you need to have your baby medically checked.
I don't want to tell you "don't worry" when we cant see your baby.
I hope your baby is ok.

Calm down, not letting people hold your baby is a little bit over the top. It wasn't really fault of the person holding him, sometimes these things happen. He is more than likely fine. He has many many more mishaps to come before he is even 1, the majority he will come out of unscathed.

I imagine the majority of parents have had a similar incident with their babies. I know I have at least once with all 3, if not more. And it's has happened to DH. It isn't intentional, it just happens.

I'm sure he's fine but like lucky2 says, it's worth talking to someone if only for your own peace of mind. I've f healthdirect really helpful on more than one occasion when our toddlers have fallen, bumped heads etc.

I know it's scary but u would know immediately by his behaviour if anything was wrong. Crying for no reason, vomiting, etc.


But honestly this is just the beginning of them getting hurt. They are very resilient. This wouldn't stop me from letting others hold my baby. Accidents happen. It very well could have been u or your other half.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Was he behaving normally in the hours after? No vomiting or excessive sleepiness for instance? I'd give one of the health lines a ring. He's more than likely fine  but it's completely understandable that you're worried and they can tell you what signs to look out for.

As PP said above we cant tell you if he's ok and you really should go by your own observations of him and seek medical advice if he isn't himself at all.

However, in the circumstances you describe there was no impact to his head at all so it's not a concussion you're looking at - it's more a whiplash type injury. I'm not a doctor but I believe that would need to be accompanied by obvious pain. If I'm wrong, I'm sorry - but in the absence of him hitting his head I don't think any sort of silent injury is likely.

He is probably absolutely fine, but take him to your GP. You won't stop worrying if you don't get it checked out, a trip to the doctor will put an end to your anguish.

It is very scary when they are so tiny.

Ok, I think that's a huge over reaction to declare no one is holding baby until he's bigger. Really is. I know first
Time parenting is a minefield, but like others said, there are
Other times he will Be hurt. 

The other day, my 3 year old DD decided it was a fantastic time to do a spin On the stairs, I barely had time to yell don't even think about it before she did it and fell down the stairs.
A cry, a cuddle and 5 mins later she was fine. Naturally I kept an eye on her, but having had her hurt herself in the past, and a trip to ED, I got a pretty useful run down of what to look out for if DD ever hurt herself.

The way you describe the scenario above, I struggle to see how he'd have hurt himself. But call the health line if you're concerned.

He will be fine

I can picture what happened as it has happened with I think each of my babies, and more than once. I agree with the others. Unless your baby is crying, squirming or in noticeable pain I wouldn't even see a doctor personally. They are not going not send you for xrays and follow up examinations if the baby is not showing signs of pain. Of course, if your baby is in pain, see a doctor.

Like a pp said, it is a tough gig being a first time parent. This seems overly irrational and unreasonable though. Perhaps you could chat to someone op as this seems a little like anxiety. I never felt this way when it happened with my kids, even as a first time parent. There will be many more bumps, falls and things to come.

When DD2 was a baby, she fell of the couch, fell off the change table - and was fine. 

When a toddler, she fell down a flight of stairs and also fell out of a shopping trolley.  

The ED told me that basically unless she was vomiting and/or sleepy/unwakeable they wouldn't treat her and assume uninjured.

No need to stop people holding her, just show them/tell them a secure way to hold her if they aren't.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
I don't think you are being unreasonable by wanting to avoid harm but it may be that you and your dp are feeling anxiety. Postnatal anxiety is very common and it often starts in pregnancy.
If you have a history of mood disorder and are tending to be plagued by fears then it might be good to talk to your chn or go.  x

Thank you everyone for taking the time to respond. I admit I may have over reacted in saying no one is holding him Untill he gets bigger LOL! I'm feeling much better about the situation today and baby seems him normal self thankfully. 
I'm not a first time mum but I have had a lot more worries this time round as he was a prem baby so I've been a bit more on guard and over protective of our precious little miracle thank you again for taking the time to respond to my over reacting. Thankfully he seems perfectly fine

My baby was a prem too. I understand being cautious. But we can't cotton wool them forever either,, it's just makes things harder for you and them. barring medical conditions, just treat your baby as if he wasn't a prem, he's still the little boy you'd have had if he wasn't prem. He's going to do stuff that will give you a heart attack on a daily basis. But he will also be ok too. 

I'm glad he's ok now!
