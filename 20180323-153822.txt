I'm typing this one handed because I am cuddling my 6mo whilst he sleeps.About an hour ago he feel from the change table in our bathroom and although seems ok - I'm racked with guilt! I phoned 13 Health and explained to 
them how he fell etc and they said just to keep a close eye on him - which of course is what I'm doing.I have heard a gazillion people say  never to leave your baby unattended and never usually do but am curious... has 
this ever happened to you?For all those wanting to give me a serve - please refrain.. trust me I feel awful enough!

Hate to admit it but DD1 fell off the change table at about the same age  I felt awful, I was right there but not holding her and she just toppled off. I know how you feel.

Yes I have, a couple of times, once they have been old and wriggly enough to worm their way off the change table jsut at the moment I take my hand off them to reach for something.  After the second incident I did all nappy 
changing on the floor instead.Your little one will probably be fine - as you've been told, keep an eye on them for a while and if anything seems strange, go straight to the doctor.Mine are all fine fortunately - and as 
toddlers did much more damage to themselves trying to climb/falling over things than they did falling off the change table.

I think most parents have had some sort of accident like this at least once, they dont usually mention it for fear of being told off!My kids have never fallen from change table but fallen off the bed plenty of times. 
 The last time DS2 fell of the bed, I had just gone to pick up my mobile from the next room as I heard a message beep.  I left the bedroom, got the phone and came straight back to him - only to see him sliding head first
 off the bed and I couldnt get to him in time to catch him.  He landed on a pile of coathangers and got a arch shaped bruise on his forehead.  Just one of those learning experiences - for us parents!

No, none of mine ever did.I hope your baby is okay.

Mine fell from the couch.  Still not sure how he managed to topple off, but anyway, it was totally my fault for putting him there even though i had him right at the back and on an angle I thought would have been okay.We
 already had a drs appointment for something else that day, so got the DR to check his head out.  Dr told me their bones are soft at this age to cope with this type of thing.  If he;s vomitting or sleeps longer than normal
 or is hard to wake, or just different in his behavour, get him checked.  I'm sure he will be fine

My DS crawled straight off the end of the bed when he was first getting proficient at crawling.He didn't want to be held so I was letting him crawl then pulling him back to the centre, I wasn't fast enough once.
He screamed for a few minutes but was fine.I am sure he is going to be dropped again soon, he is now at the tantruming stage and will fight when being held, so much fun   .Bel

Yep my DD fell off the change table at about that age. I sat her up to put a dress over her head, it got slightly twisted and whilst i scrunched the dress up to put over her head she just leaned sideways and off she went. 
She seemed fine it was just the big bruise on her chin that reminded me of the guilt for days afterward

None of mine have ever fallen off the change table. Actually, wait, DD3 has slid down the side next to the wall so she didn't actually fall but it gave me a fright. But they have dived off beds, chairs and tables, 
fallen down stairs, pulled bikes on to themselves (DD2 at 9 months gave her self a black eye trying to ride a bike), etc. And generally speaking I am right there, see it happen and just can't stop it. It's horrific.

When DS was 6mo he fell off the bed (he was rolling heaps) and i turned for a sec and then i heard a thump and cries! He didnt get a bump or anything and with a bit of mummy cuddles he was perfectly fine!Dont 
beat yourself up OP it does happen to some mothers and it doesnt mean your a bad mum at all! Accidents happen!

Wriggly little blighters aren't they?DD1 fell off the change table - I had my hand on her leg at the time and grabbed her, so she didn't totally fall but she did give her forehead a glancing blow on the floorboards. Ironically this was about 2 weeks after my GP confessed that his daughter had fallen from the change table (I'd taken DD to see him because on that occasion she'd fallen off the couch).Couch, bed, change table, and most recently DD2 fell out of the stroller. Makes me sound like mother of the year eh? I don't know a single mother whose child hasn't fallen off something at least once though. It's life, and babies are designed to cope with it.

Change table, bed (multiple times), chair...   Doesn't make you a bad mummy! Keep an eye on your little one for symptoms, and otherwise -  relax

Not a change table but a bed. We were staying in a shack and had packed everything up to go when DD was due for a sleep. So put up on the bed and put rolled up blankets around her thinking that would stop her.
 But nope. She was fine, but we all make mistakes. Don't be too tough on yourself.

Our change table has a safety belt so they haven't fallen off it ever, but have fallen off the bed not as babies.  My sil dropped her bub as a newborn, she is fine.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
DS fell out of his pram at about 5 months, where he was sitting not at all strapped in (still in the house getting ready to go)  .  I watched him closely and he was okay.A friends bub fell off her bed 
recently and sustained a concussion.  He went grey and vomitted.  Of course she took him to emergency and they observed him for four hours before releasing him.Don't feel too bad - it happens to lots of us.

DS1 - off the bed, into a chest of drawers and then hit the ground.  I think I was worse than him.DS2 - from DH's lap face first into wooden floor boards (DH paying more attention to tv than baby on his lap). 
 Blood nose and bruises.Don't stress, as long as your LO is ok, all is good.

My DD fell off the bed when she was the same age.  She's 7, and has no ill effects.  However, we have a family member with profound brain damage from a similar incident.  My DH is slowly recovering from 
letting DD fall on the floor.

My 7 month old daughter recently fell off her big sister's bed - I turned for a second to put on big sister's ballet slipper .... I know exactly how you feel - it is the most sickening feeling,
 but like all the others here my daughter was perfectly fine - not even a bruise!  Unfortunately just one of these things that happen.Hope your little one is much happier now.

On my DD1's 4th birthday, I left my 6 week old DD on the change table, in the middle, next to a window so she could get a bit of sun while I wrapped presents. All of a sudden I heard the most 
sickening thud and scream and look over to see my precious daughter, face down on the lino! DH picked her up and went to emergency after giving me a serve. I kept telling him she fell off, but
 I got the impression he didnt believe me as she was so tiny. They also questioned him at length at the hospital and I of course cried and cried for hours. No one could understand how this tiny little girl could of wriggled herself off the top end of the change table and flip over and land on her face. She was observed for a few hours and sent home. Fast forward a few days and she was laying in the top of one of those portable cots, the newborn insert that sits up a bit so you dont have to put them down so far. Well low and behold she started digging her tiny toes into the padding and thrusting her legs so the top of her head was touching the top of the "cradle" I called DH over and showed him and he was amazed! Dont beat yourself up. These things happen and what doesnt kill them makes them stronger right? lol

Yes - DS was about 10 months and I thought I had him.......it was horrible.......seemed to happen in very slow motion and I screamed as he hit the carpet as he looked all twisted    Rang the MCHN 
and took him to the Dr for a check and to our relief all was OK.I still get goosebumps thinking about it. Ditto other PP's - don't be too hard on yourself and give your baby lots of extra cuddles and kisses.

You poor thing OP.  7mo DD fell off the change table a couple of weeks ago.  I felt terrible and was too scared to change her for a day afterwards! I leaned down to get a nappy, had my hand on
 her, but she slid off and landed flat on her back.  i broke her fall with my foot, but got the fright of my life.  So did she.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
No none of mine have fell off a change table because I change them on the floor but we have had our fair share of accidents. Hope your baby is ok.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Yep. He sat up on the change table, leaned over and his giant head just kept pulling him forward till he went head first over the edge. Luckily it was the end near the cot, 
so it was more of a slide than a drop as it was a bit of a squeeze.I also threw DS in his rocker when I was carrying him down some stairs and I tripped. Despite the drop he was
 fine although he screamed blue murder until the ambos got there. They said being strapped into the rocker probably saved him.Meanwhile, my left foot was turned backwards (bad break and dislocation)
 which shows me how bad it could have been.I am glad your LO is ok.Not to freak you out, but once he becomes a toddler, he will probably be falling over and off things on a daily basis! You get nerves of steel...

Not the change table but my DD fell off my bed twice around a similar age.  I felt horribly guilty but both times she was completley unfazed & even stayed asleep on one of the times.

Nope not off a change table but off a bed and also down the stairs.
