Posting here for traffic..This morning i was settling my DS in the lounge chair in his room and a bug was crawling behind my neck so i was brushing it off at the same time as trying to stand up and in my frightened/rushed state i stumbled and dropped him.It wasn't that far i'm guessing 50cm off the ground as i was bent over and he only cried for 5mins before he had a comfort feed and fell asleep straight away but i can't stop crying, i feel so guilty.Didn't help that i rang my mum for comfort and she worried me more.Had anyone dropped their bub i feel like such a terrible mum!

Yep - I did almost the exact same thing with DD.  She was about 6 weeks old and I was totally sleep deprived.Sat down on the couch to nurse her, dozed off with her snuggled low in my arms (basically in my lap) our dog barked and I startled awake - DD rolled down my legs and into the coffee table.   I started crying hysterically and rang DH who calmed me down.  Felt like the worst mother EVER!    DD was fine- didn't even cry - but the guilt lasted a long time...ETA - You are not the worst mum ever and neither was I.  Accidents can and will happen.

Yep been there done that. I dropped DD from about 30cm onto hard floor board. She has also fallen backwards when sitting and smashed her head on the wall. It was a very loud bang. She is fine. She cried for 10 min and settled down. No need to see a doctor.   Dont feel bad or blame yourself. These things happen more then you know. You aren't a terrible mum either. Keep an eye on DS and if he is unsettled, sleepy (more so then normal) vomitting or anything thats not normal take him to the hospital. Hope that he is ok.

Try not to feel so guilty. These things do happen I passed out while holding my newborn, he ended up with a skull fracture, but he's okay now! They really are very tough

I tripped up our front steps with DD2 when she was about 6 weeks.  She fell about 45 cm onto the deck.  I started crying hysterically and rushed her to the GP but she was absolutely fine. +He actually had a giggle at how many people it happens to!  It made me feel better to know I wasn't the only one.

A pp is right, unless he is lethargic, starts vomiting or shows any other side effects he'll be fine, newborns in particular are very resilient to that kind of thing as the sutures in the skull haven't fused yet so the head molds a little to deal with the force of the fallDon't beat your self up 


+++++++++++++++++++++++
Oh you poor thing!  Unless like the pp said unless he's out of wack or throwing up then no need to worry. It does happen alot and the guilt is terrible.Even when the kids fall over themselves always worries me if they bonk their heads.

Last week I tripped while carrying DD and we both fell down on the street and she hit her head against the concrete. It was really really scary, and I felt terrible about this.I ran to a GP and she said we should go to the Children's Hospital just in case. DD was fine, thank God.Just keep an eye on him, but I am sure he will be fine.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
OP: When I was a baby my grandmother dropped me   I apparently screamed for a while but settled down and I am fine  As the PP said just monitor him to see if there are any changes. You are not a bad mother accidents will happen   ~*K*~
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
Yep. I think most people have by accident.  babies are resilliant little beings.  My dad got dropped after my grandma tripped over and he is fine.

I know how you feel. I dropped my ds he was about 10 months triped up the back step he screamed has a giant bump he face oll bleeding and a black eyes that was so swolan it was shut. We rang the ambulance, why waiting fot them he actually started to go limp and his eyes rolled back. It was the most scary thing. But he was fine after a few night stay in hospital i thought i had killed him, its amazing how strong they are. The hospital also told ne it happens all the time so dont feel bad.
					
					

+++++++++++++++++++++++
I know its upsetting but he will be okay!I did the same thing when DS was a tiny baby, and I was so hysterical that I needed medical attention but my baby was fine  Try not to beat yourself up about it.

When DD was only a few weeks old I turned my back on her for a second and my oldest tried to pick her up and put her against his shoulder but he lifted her too high and she dove head first over his shoulder and straight onto our hard lino floor   So she went head first from about 1 metre up.   I freaked out momentarily and called nurse on call and they reassured me that as long as she didn't show any signs of ill health she would be OK. And DS is old enough to know better, he got himself into BIG trouble for that, thankfully DD is now too heavy for him to pick up easily and he's pretty much stopped trying

My DD was an atrocious sleeper.  One night when she was about 2 months I was totally sleep deprived and gave her to DH who fell asleep with her on his stomach (he wasn't coping with the lack sleep either!).  She rolled off the bed and onto the floor.  She barely woke up and settled back into a deep sleep so we called an ambulance in a panic!  The hospital ran some tests and ended up concluding the fall was so minor that it hadn't even been enough to wake her up (there were clothes on the floor and a cushion that she may have fallen on)!  She is now a happy and very bright 3.5 half year old with no health problems whatsoever - but for weeks after that night I was worrying about every little thing she did/didn't do and constantly trawling the net for information about head injuries.So along with the PPs I just wanted to say don't beat yourself up!  The day after DD's fall I felt so guilty I vomited (and I never vomit) for the entire day and my Mum had to come and look after the baby and me!Maybe because of what newborns put their mothers through evolution has made them very resilient to falls.  As my Mum said to me at the time, they bounce.Hope you're feeling okay.

Thanks so much everyone im feeling much better now..DS is sleeping but keeps squirming as he usually does (he gets bad wind and has silent reflux)But i keep freaking out and checking on him lol.I've been in his room about 20times in the last 10mins.I feel much better knowing its happened to others.When i rang my mum in hysterics. She told me to keep it to myself in case people think it was some form of child abuse ... Then went on to tell me she never dropped us kids and i need to be more careful.Luckily DP was home to comfort me and CJ

i fell down the stairs with DS after blacking out

Ds1 rolled of the bed when he was a few weeks old I had just pit him down to grab clean shirt as he had vomitted one. The guilt was incredible and I certainlycried worse then him. Ds2's pram took off from me when I tripped one day and went down a tiny set of stairs landing face first on the concrete. I was screaming and panicing. He needed a little ice pack but all was okay. He was a few months old. I was leaving a cafe. Thankfully they were very helpful and sat me down for a little while had staff look after ds1 for me while I and baby calmed down. Have a cuppa while he sleeps to calm your nerves. Xo

You poor thing, you must have gotten such a fright. You aren't a bad Mum at all.Hopefully your Mum will be more supportive soon!

Hi, When my youngest was 6 months old MIL was holding her while sitting at a hard formica table.  DD threw her self back  and whacked her little head  on the table.  It was the first bang on the head that she had and she fair screamed.  MIL must of felt guilty and tried calming her down but she screamed and screamed she wanted me but MIL wouldn't let me have her. She just walked around trying to calm her I was so annoyed she wouldn't give me my baby   but I could see that it was because she felt bad and just wanted to calm her. DD was fine and did settle down  but it took me quite a while longer to calm down  and probably MIL too.You are definetly not a bad Mum, things like this seem to happen often.

I think it has happened to everyone at some stage. Hubby has accidentally dropped the first 2, he swears he won't drop the current one   I've fallen up some stairs while carrying #2 as a baby and only just managed to get my hand under his head before it would have cracked on the sharp metal tread.#2 is so accident prone he probably would have done it himself  I swear that kid is so lucky he has a thick skull! Accidents happen ... so long as you know to lookout for signs of concussion or serious injury, it is okay.

My bro dropped my son on his head when he was only 3months old. He tried to carry him in his little portable bed without lifting him out first as he didnt want to wake him....and DS rolled out and hit the floor.It was pretty awful as all my family and my bros inlaws were there for a function and DS wouldnt stop screaming and screaming and i nearly called an ambulance.My poor bro was bawling his eyes out and my other bro really made him feel worse by his reaction. I assured him that it was just an accident.I rang the hospital for advice and they were happy for him to be watched at home and yeah he was more than fine and fell from alot higher than 50cm so dont worry accidents happen

QUOTE Hubby has accidentally dropped the first 2, he swears he won't drop the current oneROFLDD fell out of a Bunnings trolley. I had two massive 10L tins of pain and a smaller 4L plus another younger child trying to manoeuvre the trolley in the carpark so I plonked the baby in the trolley and the trolley went over a bump. She went out head first.There was a nice lump and I couldn't stop crying, DD had calmed down and the Bunnings staff were trying to calm me down. I felt so bad - worse still I was anti children in trolleys unless strapped in Never happened again I can tell you. DD didn't need a doctor either.

Dont worry, we have all been there. Maybe just take him pot eh GP for a check up to ease your worries.Oh, When dd1 was a bub, I was rocking her in the pram, I was sleep deprived, crying baby in the early hours, somehow !! dd fell out of the back of the pram, head first on tiles. I was crying for hours and to this day think about it..7 years later!     But she is fine!
